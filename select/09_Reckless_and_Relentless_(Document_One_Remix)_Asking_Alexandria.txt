Music is fucking dead
It's thanks to you cunts stabbing it in the fucking chest
You, and every one of these fake, righteous, undeserving bands
Fuck you
Through sin and self destruction I stumble home,
Never alone
My only home is the bottom of a bottle and a rolled up bill and I'm ready to go!
I live the same day in and out and I don't care how long I last,
On the constant drink and drugs and don't get me wrong I'm having a fucking blast.

I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of,
I am rock and roll at it's fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt,
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa whoa
I guess I'm never gonna learn

Just like the cigarettes hurt,
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa whoa
I guess I'm never gonna learn
You cannot stop me till my heart stops beating,
You cannot stop me till my last breathe comes,
I'm gonna go until I hit the floor
Can't find a way back to my feet
Anymore

Pass me a glass and lets destroy everything in this fucking place like a million miles an hour you pussy's can't keep up with this fucking pace,
I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of,
I am rock and roll at it's fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt,
Just like the whiskey burns, wohoa wohoa
I guess I'm never gonna learn
Just like the cigarettes hurt,
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa whoa
I guess I'm never gonna learn

I've drunk the last time you stood here, you're by my side,
You thought that it should be just like the good old days of rock and roll
Without a drink, without regret without a second thought
You hit the nail on the head with the back of your fucking throat
I am rock and roll living a life we can only dream of
I am rock and roll at it's fucking finest

Music is fucking dead
It's thanks to you cunts stabbing it in the fucking chest
You, and every one of these fake, righteous, undeserving bands
Fuck you
